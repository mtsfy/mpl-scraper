_It is very basic and I do not know if it works for every MyProgrammingLab product._

## ðŸ”¨ Setup

- Login to your MyProgrammingLab account and navigate to the lab.
- Open up the console in your browser.

  - `userId`
  - `sessionSectionId`
- Get the excerise IDs:
  - `https://pearson.turingscraft.com/codelab/jsp/userControl/exerciseSummary.jsp?restart=restart`
  - Get attempted exercises by clicking the `Total Correct`

## ðŸš€ Usage

- Plug in the above variables accordingly in the `index.js` file.
- Run the script by copying the script and pasting it in the console.
- It will take 2+ minutes to run depending on the number of exercises.
- After it is done, it will download a `markdown` file with the results.
